@article{Lighthill1971,
	abstract = {The elongated-body theory of the reactive forces on a fish moving in water (that is, forces resulting from the inertia of associated water movements) is extended so that a prediction of instantaneous reactive force between fish and water is obtained for fish motions of arbitrary amplitude, regular or irregular ({\S}2). A preliminary application of the theory to the balance of reactive thrust and resistive drag in regular carangiform swimming of fishes with slender caudal fins is made ({\S}3). Comparison with data (Bainbridge 1963) on the dace Leuciscus suggests that an important feature of this balance may be a substantial enhancement of drag for such fishes when swimming movements commence, an enhancement here interpreted in terms of a boundary-layer-thinning mechanism first suggested by Dr Quentin Bone.},
